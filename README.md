#Summary
Polyglot is a Google Chrome extension that helps to get a transplation of any word while reading a webpage. 
Polyglot supports several translation engines (and it's planned to add more): 
- [Abbyy Lingvo](http://www.lingvo-online.ru/ru/Translate/en-ru) 
- [Multitran](http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?a=1&SHL=2)
- [WordReference](http://wordreference.com)

Polyglot supports translation from/to English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish languages. 

#Installation 
Currently Polyglot isn't delivered through Chrome Web Store, so you have to clone the repository and install it manually from the "Extensions" tab.
